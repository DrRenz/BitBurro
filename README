If you've stumbled upon this nice little piece of software, probably
it was for good reason ;-)

BitBurro is a very simple, but not stupid, one-click web-based file
hosting solution written in PHP, which can be used to drop files for
later pickup, or create a one-time upload dir for reception of files. 

The solution is based on roughly six different php scripts and some
html template files; it's not designed to be holistic in any way!
After searching around the web, none of the simple "web-upload your
files and manage them online" approaches did fit the task very well,
as all of them were either too complicated for Joe Average (the "file
management approach") or too simple (e.g. no upload ticket possible,
the "unidirectional approach"). Right now the project is running in
an evaluation phase on a publicly accessible web server in my company
for data distribution to our customers and partners, with positive
feedback so far.

It's not a substitute for a full-blown ftp server, but an ad-hoc
solution for the occasional need to transfer mid-size to large files
not suited for email transfer from or to people only known by their
email addresses.

It includes password protection, configurable file aging / auto-cleanup
and, for added security, the option for a two-server setup, where files
uploaded are moved from the external web server to an internal secure
storage, while still maintaining one-click accessibility.

As this is only a pet project for the developers, don't expect a fully
cleaned and documented build tree ;-)
